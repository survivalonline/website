# About
This server is a non-profit Minecraft "vanilla" survival server running PaperMC. We do not sell any cosmetics, I am simply hosting the server<br>
to give to the Minecraft community, a server without Administrative interference. (we will only intervene to delete things that undermine server preformance, however we will never ban players).<br>
We host the survival gamemode, as provided by Mojang. We do not set any of our own rules to the server,<br>
allowing players to freely play and explore with regular clients and modded/hacked clients.<br>

Mojang requires its players to follow their EULA and community guidelines, so please comply with thoes.<br>
Chat reporting is disabled on our server, as we do not want that.<br>
